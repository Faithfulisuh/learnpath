Of course. Here is a breakdown of the Python development for the Course Recommendation System, divided into actionable tasks and steps based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD).

### Phase 1: Foundation and Core Algorithm Development

This phase focuses on setting up the environment and building the individual recommendation algorithms as standalone components.

---
**Task 1: Set Up the Development Environment** ‚öôÔ∏è
This initial step ensures that the project has a stable and reproducible foundation.

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** Use `venv` or `conda` to isolate project dependencies.
2.  **Install Core Libraries:** Install essential Python libraries for data handling, machine learning, and basic analysis.
    * `pandas` for data manipulation and loading datasets.
    * `numpy` for numerical operations.
    * `scikit-learn` for TF-IDF, similarity metrics (cosine), k-NN, and evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, NDCG).
    * `scipy` for handling sparse matrices in CF and MF.
    * `jupyter` or `vscode` for interactive development and data exploration.
3.  **Set Up Version Control:** Initialize a Git repository to track code changes.

**Task 2: Develop the Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Pipeline** üßπ
This task is crucial for preparing the raw data into a format that the recommendation algorithms can use.

1.  **Load Data:** Write Python scripts to load the course and user data based on the schemas defined in the PRD (sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2).
2.  **Clean Data:** Handle missing values and ensure data consistency, as per the quality requirements (section 6.1.3). For example, standardize skill tags and organization names.
3.  **Feature Extraction:**
    * Use `scikit-learn's` `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text data like course titles and skills into numerical vectors.
    * Encode categorical features (e.g., organization, level) into a machine-readable format.

**Task 3: Implement the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) Component** üß†
This component will provide content-based recommendations.

1.  **Define Case Representation:** Create a Python class or function that represents a course as a feature vector using the preprocessed data.
2.  **Calculate Similarity:** Implement a function to calculate the weighted cosine similarity between a user's profile (interests, goals) and the course feature vectors.
3.  **Retrieve Cases:** Use `scikit-learn's` `NearestNeighbors` or a custom function to find the top-N most similar courses (cases) for a given user profile.
4.  **Generate Explanations:** Create a mechanism to explain recommendations based on which features had the highest similarity score (e.g., "Recommended because it matches your interest in 'Data Science'").

**Task 4: Implement the Collaborative Filtering (CF) Component** üë•
This component will leverage community data to find recommendations.

1.  **Create User-Item Matrix:** Use `pandas` and `scipy` to build a sparse matrix of user-course interactions (enrollments, ratings).
2.  **Calculate Similarity:**
    * **User-Based CF:** Implement a function to calculate similarity between users using Pearson correlation or cosine similarity.
    * **Item-Based CF:** Implement a function to calculate similarity between courses based on common user interactions.
3.  **Generate Recommendations:** Write a function that takes a user ID, finds similar users (or items), and recommends courses they have rated highly but the target user has not yet seen.

**Task 5: Implement the Matrix Factorization (MF) Component** üî¢
This component will uncover latent patterns in the data.

1.  **Decompose the Matrix:** Use `scikit-learn's` `TruncatedSVD` (for SVD) or `NMF` to decompose the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional user and item matrices.
2.  **Predict Ratings:** Reconstruct the matrix from its decomposed factors to predict ratings for courses a user hasn't interacted with.
3.  **Generate Recommendations:** For a given user, recommend the items with the highest predicted ratings that they have not yet seen.

**Task 6: Build the Offline Evaluation Framework** üìä
This framework will be used to test the performance of the algorithms.

1.  **Split Data:** Create a script to split the historical interaction data into training and testing sets.
2.  **Implement Metrics:** Write functions to calculate the offline metrics specified in the PRD (section 7.1.1), including Precision@K, Recall@K, and NDCG.
3.  **Run and Log Experiments:** Create a script to run each algorithm (CBR, CF, MF) against the test data and log the results to compare their performance.

### Phase 2: Hybrid System Integration and Optimization

This phase focuses on combining the individual algorithms into a sophisticated hybrid system.

---
**Task 7: Develop the Hybrid Ensemble Strategy** üß¨
The goal is to intelligently combine the outputs of the three models.

1.  **Implement Weighted Combination:** Create a function that takes the recommendation lists from CBR, CF, and MF and combines them using a weighted score. The weights should be dynamic based on the user's context (e.g., higher weight for CBR for new users).
2.  **Implement Switching Strategy:** Develop logic that selects the most appropriate algorithm based on rules defined in the PRD (section 4.2.1), such as using CBR for cold-start users and CF for users with a rich history.
3.  **Generate a Unified List:** Ensure the final output is a single, ranked list of recommendations, handling duplicates and diversifying the results.

**Task 8: Implement Confidence Scoring and Explanation Generation** ‚ú®
This task is key to providing transparency to the user.

1.  **Calculate Individual Confidence:** For each algorithm, develop a method to calculate a confidence score for its recommendations as specified in the PRD (section 4.2.2).
2.  **Calculate Ensemble Confidence:** Combine the individual confidence scores into a final score for each recommendation in the hybrid list.
3.  **Enhance Explanations:** Expand the explanation mechanism to state which algorithms contributed to a recommendation (e.g., "Recommended because it is popular among your peers (CF) and matches your skill goals (CBR)").

**Task 9: Optimize for Performance and "Beyond Accuracy" Metrics** üöÄ
Focus on speed and the quality of the recommendation list.

1.  **Implement Caching:** Add a simple caching layer (e.g., using Python dictionaries or a library like `functools.lru_cache`) to store recommendations for active users to reduce computation time.
2.  **Measure and Improve Diversity & Novelty:** Implement the "beyond accuracy" metrics from the PRD (section 7.1.1) and adjust the ensemble strategy to improve the diversity and novelty of the recommendation lists.

### Phase 3: Production Backend Development

This phase focuses on turning the Python scripts and models into a robust, scalable service.

---
**Task 10: Build a RESTful API** üåê
This API will serve the recommendations to the frontend application.

1.  **Choose a Framework:** Select a lightweight Python web framework like **FastAPI** or **Flask**.
2.  **Define Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for fetching recommendations (e.g., `/recommendations/{user_id}`), submitting feedback, and getting explanations.
3.  **Integrate Recommendation Logic:** Connect the API endpoints to the hybrid recommendation engine developed in Phase 2.
4.  **Implement I/O Models:** Use a library like `pydantic` (native in FastAPI) to validate incoming requests and format outgoing responses, ensuring data consistency.

**Task 11: Set Up the Model Serving Infrastructure** üì¶
This involves preparing the trained models to be used by the live API.

1.  **Model Serialization:** Write scripts to save the trained models (e.g., the SVD decomposer, the TF-IDF vectorizer) to disk using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle`.
2.  **Model Loading:** Ensure the API can load these serialized models into memory on startup for fast predictions.
3.  **Create a Retraining Pipeline:** Develop a script that can be run on a schedule (e.g., daily or weekly) to retrain the models with fresh user interaction data and update the serialized model files.

**Task 12: Implement Monitoring and Logging** üìà
This is essential for maintaining the health of the production system.

1.  **Logging:** Integrate Python's built-in `logging` module throughout the API to log requests, errors, and key events.
2.  **Performance Monitoring:** Add timing decorators to key functions to monitor the response time of recommendation generation and other critical parts of the system, ensuring it stays below the 200ms target.
3.  **Health Check Endpoint:** Create a simple `/health` endpoint that the production environment can use to verify that the service is running correctly.

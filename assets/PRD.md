# Course Recommendation System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Overview
The Course Recommendation System is a hybrid intelligent platform that leverages Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), Collaborative Filtering (CF), and Matrix Factorization (MF) to provide personalized course recommendations to learners. The system addresses the challenge of course discovery in an increasingly crowded online learning landscape by combining content-based intelligence with collaborative patterns and latent factor analysis.

- Limited consideration of course characteristics and learner context

### 1.3 Solution Approach
A hybrid recommendation system that:
- Uses CBR for content-based recommendations and explainable suggestions
- Employs CF to leverage community learning patterns and peer similarities
- Utilizes MF to discover hidden patterns in course-learner interactions
- Combines all three approaches through an intelligent ensemble method
- Provides transparent, explainable recommendations with confidence scores
